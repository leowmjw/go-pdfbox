# go-pdfbox

## Documentation

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/sfomuseum/go-pdfbox.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sfomuseum/go-pdfbox)

## Motivation

My hope is that eventually this package can be retired in favour of being able to invoke a WASM-compiled version of `pdfbox`. Until then this package exists.
